## 0.8.0

+ New mechanism for loading Zygisk without property modifying, in order to provide stronger hiding effects
+ Drop support for 32 bit applications (zygote 32 will not be injected)
+ Require **SELinux enforced** because it is necessary to prevent `vold` from aborting Zygisk fuse connection
+ Fix compatibility for Magisk (minimal version 26300) and support reading Magisk denylist for `PROCESS_ON_DENYLIST` flag (currently isolated processes cannot be flagged properly)
